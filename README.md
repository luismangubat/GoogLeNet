# GoogLeNet
GoogLeNet implementation for the Distracted Driving Dataset

GoogLenet is a deep convolutional neural network that was proposed by Szegedy and other Google researchers. This network architecture won the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2014 (ILSVRC-2014) where it attained 92.3% classification performance. GoogLeNet was designed in a special architecture that allows for increasing in depth and width of the network but keeping the computing resource.
